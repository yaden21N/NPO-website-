               <p class="imageMessage">At Somerset West Night Shelter, our objectives are deeply rooted in our
                  commitment to supporting
                  the homeless community. We aim to provide a safe and secure environment where individuals in need can
                  find refuge.
                  Our primary goal is to offer immediate relief through shelter, food, and basic necessities, ensuring
                  that no one has
                  to endure the hardships of homelessness alone.

                  Despite the difficulties, homelessness is not always a permanent state, and with adequate support
                  systems, including affordable
                  housing, job opportunities, and mental health services, many individuals can transition back into
                  stable living environments.
                  Addressing homelessness requires a collective effort from governments, communities, and social
                  organizations.

            <h3 id="goals"><strong>Community Impact :</strong> </h3>
            <p id="goals">Over the years, the Somerset West Night Shelter has made a significant impact on reducing
               homelessness in the Helderberg District.
               By addressing both immediate needs and long-term rehabilitation, the shelter helps individuals regain
               stability and reintegrate into society.
               Their efforts also foster greater community awareness and involvement in tackling homelessness.</p>

            <img src="images/logos/home-logo.png" class="infoLogo" alt="logo of NPO">
            <p id="goals">When someone arrives at the shelter, our dedicated volunteers offer the homeless secure
               accommodation,
               along with an evening meal, breakfast, and access to warm showers.
               Beyond immediate assistance, we strive to empower our residents by connecting them with essential
               services such as
               healthcare, counseling, and job training. We believe in fostering a sense of dignity and hope, helping
               individuals
               rebuild their lives and regain their independence. Additionally, we conduct various workshops among many
               other services.</p>

            <img src="images/logos/donation-logo.png" class="infoLogo" alt="hand in hand">
            <p id="goals">We are also dedicated to raising awareness about homelessness in our community, advocating for
               long-term
               solutions, and collaborating with local organizations and volunteers to create a supportive network. Our
               ultimate
               objective is to not only alleviate the effects of homelessness but to address its root causes, working
               towards a future
               where everyone has the opportunity to live with security and dignity. If many people make small changes ,
               together we
               can make a big difference by taking many homeless
               people off the street. We still believe that humanity is alive ! </p>
